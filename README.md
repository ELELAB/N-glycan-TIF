This repository contains N-glycan abundance data from tumor/normal interstitial fluids and serum obtained from a cohort of patients with breast cancer. The repository was made with intent of openly sharing both data and R-scripts used in analysis in relation to the publication.

The repository contains two folders:

    (1) N-glycan abundance data and patient metadata. These are the data used as the starting point for our analyses.
    (2) A collection of Rscripts that recapitulate our work:
                                    
         (a) N_Glycan_Functions.R (Packages and Custom Functions, N.B: must be run as the initial script.)
         (b) N_Glycan_Analysis_All.R (Differential Expression Analysis using all available TIF and NIF samples.)
         (c) N_Glycan_Analysis_Paired.R (Differential Expression Analysis using only TIF-NIF paired samples.)
         (d) N_Glycan_Survival_Analysis.R (Survival Analysis, cox proportional hazard regression.)
         (e) N_Glycan_Serum_Analysis.R (Serum-TIF Correlation Analysis, overlap with MDG serum cohort.)
         (f) N_Glycan_Figures.R (Generates All Plots used in the publication.)
                                    
Aditionally the folder with R-scripts contains a sub-folder with dataframes generated by scripts a-e, which may be used for easy plotting using script f, or to check results.

Requirements:
                                   
    R version 3.3.1 or higher
    Rstudio version 1.1.383 or higher        
    Bioconductor version 3.6 or higher	

Although R-packages should automatically be installed and errors raised if they cannot be, we here provide the user with the list of required packages for manual installation:

CRAN:

    limma
    sva
    openxlsx
    ggplot2
    dendextend
    heatmap.plus
    reshape
    gdata
    plyr
    data.table
    RColorBrewer
    squash
    survminer
    car
    
Bioconductor:

    survcomp
                   

Notes:

a) We suggest to use Rstudio to run the scripts of interest so that you can follow the analyses one line at the time and digest the results.

b) The scripts need to be run in the same folder where the N-glycan data and patient metadata are stored. Otherwise, the user would need to modify them with the right path.

c) N.B.  It is vital that the script N_Glycan_Functions.R is always run as the initital script as this scripts contains packages and costum functions needed for running the rest of the code.
